;; Force a collection.
;; On entry:
;;  ECX = generation to collect (-1 for all)
;;  EDX = mode (default, forced or optimized)
;;
;; This helper is special because it's not called via a p/invoke that transitions to pre-emptive mode. We do
;; this because the GC wants to be called in co-operative mode. But we are going to cause a GC, so we need to
;; make this stack crawlable. As a result we use the same trick as the allocation helpers and build an
;; explicit transition frame based on the entry state so the GC knows where to start crawling this thread's
;; stack.
