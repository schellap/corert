; Defines optional fields for GenericInstanceDesc.
;
; Each line describes a single field; the name (used to create the names of the generated accessors to get the
; field offset, get or set the value), the field type, the name of a flag that determines whether this field
; is present in a particular GenericInstanceDesc or not (GID_ will be prepended) and finally an optional value
; that if provided indicates the field is an array of the given type whose size is determined by the field
; named by the value (which obviously must be non-optional for all the cases where the array field is
; non-optional).
;
; This file is input to the WriteOptionalFieldsCode.pl script in rh\tools which will in turn write the result
; into rh\src\inc\GenericInstanceDescFields.h (the script requires no parameters currently, everything is
; hardcoded and all that's required is that you check out GenericInstanceDescFields.h from source code control
; first -- these fields will change seldom enough that we don't run the script during build and instead
; updates are manual).
