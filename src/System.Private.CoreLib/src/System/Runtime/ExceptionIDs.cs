// @TODO: this type is related to throwing exceptions out of Rtm. If we did not have to throw
// out of Rtm, then we would note have to have the code below to get a classlib exception object given
// an exception id, or the special functions to back up the MDIL THROW_* instructions, or the allocation
// failure helper. If we could move to a world where we never throw out of Rtm, perhaps to other generated code, 
// then we could remove all of this.
